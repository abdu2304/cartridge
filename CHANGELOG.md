# Changelog

Every Cartridge release, newest first. Each GitHub release only lists its own changes.

## Cartridge 0.8.0 · Your Library, Alive

### New
- **Play time.** Cartridge reads how long you've played each game from Steam, and from RetroArch's own logs when "Save runtime log" is on. The game page shows it (for example "12 h played · 2 d ago").
- **New Home rows.** Most played, Finish what you started, Short games (under 5 hours to beat), Top rated you haven't played, and Local multiplayer. Each only shows up when it has enough games.
- **Timeline.** Game page → More → Timeline: when the game was added to RomM, downloaded, added to Steam, your first and latest trophy, and when you last played, with your total time.
- **Edit details.** Game page → More → Edit details: change the name and description, or use the cover you picked from SteamGridDB, and save it to RomM for every device.
- **Theme from this game.** Game page → More: Cartridge takes its colours from the game's cover. "Back to your own theme" in the same menu undoes it.
- **Upload to RomM.** Settings → RomM lists files in your console folders that RomM doesn't have yet, and uploads them one by one or all at once. Run a scan in RomM afterwards to add them to your library.
- **Server status.** Settings → About shows your RomM server: online or not, LAN or tunnel, response time, version, how many consoles and games it holds, library size and where its metadata comes from.
- **Idle screen.** After a few minutes without input, your games' artwork drifts by with a big clock. Any button wakes it, and that press does nothing else. Choose 3, 5, 10 or 15 minutes, or turn it off, in Look & feel.
- **Word suggestions on the on-screen keyboard.** When searching, your game names appear above the keys as you type. Pick a whole title, or finish the word you're typing.
- **Console backgrounds.** New backgrounds in the style of the PlayStation 2, Wii, Wii U, Switch, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Xbox and Xbox 360, each with its own colours and motion. The brighter ones are toned down so text stays readable.
- **Refresh artwork in Steam.** Settings → Steam → Refresh artwork gives every game Cartridge added new art: your own picks, or SteamGridDB's most popular, clean, alternate, blurred or material styles. It goes straight into Steam when Steam can be reached, otherwise after a restart.
- **Free up space.** Settings → Storage picks games you haven't played for two months (biggest first) for you to check before deleting. Nothing is deleted until you press Delete.

### Changed
- **HowLongToBeat card.** The game page shows a small card with the HowLongToBeat logo (from your RomM server) and the times as big numbers, each with a bar.
- **Latest achievements on Home show when you unlocked them.** Each shows the time ("12 min ago" today), with Today, Yesterday or the day between them, like a timeline.
- **Background picker.** Look & feel shows the background you're using in one row, and Change opens a list: your theme colours (XMB Waves, Ribbons), the consoles, and Still, Game artwork or Wallpaper. Bokeh, Blades, Dots and Glow are gone; if you used one, you now get XMB Waves.
- **Storage by drive.** Each drive shows which consoles download to it, including console folders on other drives.
- **QR pairing asks RomM for permission to change games,** for Edit details and Upload. If you paired before 0.8, pair again, or sign in with your password, to use them.


## Cartridge 0.7.13 · Console Cards

### Changed
- **New console cards.** Each card is filled with the console's own colours, with a glossy top edge, the controller picture large on the right fading out to the left, and the game count in a small pill. The selected card lifts with a glow in the console's colour. The same cards are used on Home.
- **New Consoles header.** A clean "Consoles" title with big numbers underneath: consoles, games, on this device and last sync.
- **LAN and Tunnel label.** The coloured dot is gone. The top bar shows a light green "LAN" or a light purple "Tunnel" on a dark see-through pill, so it stays readable on any background colour.

### Fixed
- The console picture and the colour strip were cut off at the bottom and right edges of each card. The picture now always sits inside the card.
- "1 games" now reads "1 game".

## Cartridge 0.7.12 · Smoother

### Fixed
- **Games added to Steam no longer get `%command%` in their Launch options.** When Cartridge added a game while Steam was running, Steam filled in `%command%` by itself, and with the emulator's settings in Target that stopped RetroArch, Xbox, Xbox 360, 3DS and Dreamcast games from starting. Cartridge now checks what Steam saved after adding a game and clears it again.
- **Games already affected are fixed with Update.** Their console page in Settings → Steam shows Update; pressing it clears `%command%` in place, so play time and the shortcut stay as they are.

### Changed
- **Smoother moving around, most of all in Game Mode.** Rows, shelves and lists now scroll without redrawing the whole screen, the background is drawn in a way that is cheaper to show, and focusing a game no longer redraws its shadow on every frame in reduced effects mode. In tests without the GPU this cut the drawing work while moving around by about a third. Nothing looks different.

## Cartridge 0.7.11 · Launch Fix

### Fixed
- **RetroArch and Xbox games should now start.** Games kept in a folder (multi-disc PS1, Dreamcast, cue/bin and m3u sets) were handed to the emulator as a folder, which RetroArch and xemu can't open. Cartridge now points the shortcut at the game file inside: the .m3u playlist, the .cue or .gdi, or the console's game file.
- **Shortcuts are written the way Steam ROM Manager writes them.** The emulator and its arguments go in Target, and Launch options stay empty, exactly like EmuDeck's own shortcuts (for example `"xemu-emu.sh" -full-screen -dvd_path "Sonic Riders.iso"`). Launch options are only used when something has to wrap the command. Games you already added show an **Update** button on their console page in Settings → Steam; press it to rewrite them.
- **PS3 games you added to Steam yourself are recognised.** RPCS3 shortcuts that start a game by its serial (`%RPCS3_GAMEID%:BCUS...`) now count as In Steam, and names match even when punctuation or ™ differ.

### New
- **Missing from Steam list.** Settings → Steam shows "N missing from Steam". It opens a list of every downloaded game with no shortcut, grouped by console. A adds one, X adds all.
- **PS Vita games installed in Vita3K.** Vita games must be installed inside Vita3K first (File → Install .pkg or .vpk). Once installed, Cartridge adds them to Steam and Vita3K starts them by title ID. Games not installed yet say so instead of making a shortcut that won't work.
- **Series show a picture** in their header, taken from their games.

### Changed
- **Tidier library toolbar.** Show and Sort are each one button with a menu. Surprise me, Select games and Get all are together under More.
- A highlighted game in a collection or series no longer covers the console heading above it.

## Cartridge 0.7.10 · Emulator List

### Changed
- **The Emulator picker only lists what you have, once.** EmuDeck's launchers are often a wrapper: `dolphin-emu.sh` runs the Dolphin Flatpak, `pcsx2-qt.sh` runs the AppImage in ~/Applications. Cartridge now reads the launcher and doesn't list that same copy again. A copy that really is separate (an AppImage in another folder) is still listed.
- **Cartridge knows many more emulators**, taken from EmuDeck's and Steam ROM Manager's setups: MAME (arcade), ares (NES, SNES, N64, Game Boy, Mega Drive and more), simple64 and Parallel Launcher (N64), bsnes (SNES), Nestopia (NES), Stella (Atari 2600), Ymir (Saturn), ScummVM and BigPEmu, plus Flycast for NAOMI and Atomiswave. They're only offered when installed.
- **Many more RetroArch cores and consoles**, including Atari, Amiga, MSX, PC Engine CD, Neo Geo, WonderSwan, 3DO and DOS.
- Flycast gets its fullscreen option when it isn't started through EmuDeck.

## Cartridge 0.7.9 · Every Setup

### Changed
- **Cartridge finds your emulators however you installed them.** Settings → Steam used to look only for EmuDeck launchers, AppImages and one Flatpak per emulator. It now also finds:
  - **Programs from your distro** (for example `dolphin-emu`, `pcsx2-qt`, `retroarch` on your PATH).
  - **More Flatpaks**: Ryujinx (Ryubing), Lime3DS and Citra, Eden, Citron, Sudachi, mGBA, Flycast, melonDS, Rosalie's Mupen GUI.
  - **RetroArch from anywhere**: EmuDeck, Flatpak, AppImage, your distro, or RetroArch on Steam, each with the cores it has.
- **Every copy is listed.** If you have an emulator twice (say the Flatpak and an AppImage), both show in the Emulator picker and you choose.
- **Standalone emulators for more consoles**: mGBA for Game Boy, GBC and GBA, Rosalie's Mupen GUI for N64, Flycast for Dreamcast, next to RetroArch.

### Fixed
- **Games on a symlinked home folder** (Bazzite and other image-based systems) are now given to emulators by their real path, which sandboxed emulators can always open.

## Cartridge 0.7.8 · Launch Fixes

### Fixed
- **RetroArch games didn't start** (NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Dreamcast and the rest). Cartridge gave RetroArch the full path to its core, which the Flatpak RetroArch can't see on systems like Bazzite, where home is under /var/home. Cores now go by name, the way EmuDeck's Steam ROM Manager setup does it, and RetroArch finds them itself.
- **Xbox games didn't start.** Cartridge looked for the wrong EmuDeck launcher and left out xemu's options. It now uses `xemu-emu.sh -full-screen -dvd_path "<game>"`, like EmuDeck.
- **Xbox 360 games didn't start.** Xenia runs under Proton, so the game now gets a Windows path (`"Z:<game>"`), like EmuDeck.
- **Shortcuts made by Steam ROM Manager weren't recognised.** ROM Manager puts the arguments in Target and leaves Launch options empty. Cartridge now reads them, so those games show as In Steam and their setup is copied for new games.
- **The same game could show twice in a series**, and near-identical series ("Mario" and "Mario Bros.") showed separately. They are now one series.
- Launch options for PS1, PSP, DS and Switch (Ryujinx) now match EmuDeck's.

### New
- **Pick the emulator for each console (Settings → Steam → a console → Emulator).** Lists the emulators installed for that console, including RetroArch with each core you have, for example DuckStation or RetroArch · SwanStation for PS1. New shortcuts use your pick.
- **Update games already in Steam.** When a console's setup changes, its page says how many games use the older setup, and **Update** replaces those shortcuts.
- **Game icons in Steam.** Added games get an icon: SteamGridDB's square icon, or the cover cut square.
- **New genre tiles**, each in its own colour with a genre icon and a column of covers.
- **Collections, series and genres are split by console**, with the console's logo on each section, when they span more than one.
- **New Downloads screen when nothing is downloading.**

## Cartridge 0.7.7 · Steam Logo Fix

### Fixed
- **Logos on games added to Steam could show blank.** Steam only shows a shortcut's logo once it has a position, so Cartridge now saves one (bottom left) right after the logo, the same way the SteamGridDB Decky plugin does. Applies when games are added live through Decky Loader.

## Cartridge 0.7.6 · Steam Fixes

### Fixed
- **Adding games to Steam in Game Mode.** Game Mode starts Steam again the moment it closes, so Cartridge's changes could be lost or never written, and the top bar stayed on "Waiting for Steam…". When Decky Loader is installed, Cartridge now adds games straight into the running Steam, the same way the SteamGridDB plugin changes artwork: shortcut, launch options, artwork and collections, with no restart. Removing works the same way.
- **Restart Steam from Game Mode.** When Decky Loader is installed, Restart Steam asks Steam to restart itself, like the SteamGridDB plugin does.
- **Without Decky Loader**, Cartridge now watches much more closely for Steam closing in Game Mode, so the change is written before Game Mode brings Steam back.

### New
- **Live changes (Settings → Steam).** Shows whether Steam takes changes live. Without Decky Loader, **Turn on** adds the same small file Decky uses to open Steam's interface to apps on this device. Restart Steam once afterwards.

### Changed
- **One "Change metadata" entry in a game's More menu** instead of three. It opens Change cover, Change logo, Change background and Reset artwork.

## Cartridge 0.7.5 · Fixes and Polish

### New
- **Steam consoles have their own page (Settings → Steam).** Each console is now a card with its logo, how many games you have and how many are in Steam. Open one to see every downloaded game for that console with **In Steam** or **Not in Steam**, and add or remove each one with A. **Add all** adds the rest in one go. The emulator setup (Target, Start in, Launch options) is shown at the top, and **More** holds Edit, Test and how games start.
- **How long to beat on every game page.** Main story, Main + extras and Completionist times. Cartridge uses RomM's times when it has them, and otherwise asks HowLongToBeat itself. Results are saved, so each game is looked up once.

### Changed
- **New collection and series tiles.** Collections and series show a game's artwork with its covers fanned on top, and a series shows its game logo. Genres keep their tiles.

### Fixed
- **The Steam collection list couldn't scroll** past the first few collections with a controller, and the rows squashed together. Long pop-up menus had the same problem.
- **A game page wouldn't scroll back up to its banner** after you scrolled down. Moving back to the buttons now shows the top of the page again.
- **Console tiles showed square edges** when highlighted: the colour strip and faded logo slipped past the rounded corners.

## Cartridge 0.7.0 · The Library Update

### New
- **Collections.** A Collections row on Home and a Collections page.
  - **Your own collections**, made in Cartridge and saved in RomM, so every device and RomM's web page have them. Make one with **New collection**, add games from a game page (More → Add to a collection) or many at once from the Library. Rename or delete them from the collection's page.
  - **Made by Cartridge:** Top rated, Hidden gems (rated highly by few people), Couch multiplayer and Short games (under 5 hours), built from your library.
  - **Series:** every series with two or more games, in release order.
  - RomM's own collections and smart collections are still there.
- **Genres.** A row of genre tiles on Home and a Genres page. LB and RB switch genre.
- **Customise the top bar (Look & Feel → Top bar).** Show or hide any tab and change the order: Home, Library, Consoles, Genres, Collections, Achievements, Downloads. Settings always stays. LT and RT follow your order.
- **Play status and favourites, synced with RomM.** From a game's More menu: add to favourites, set Playing now, Backlog, Finished, Completed 100%, Gave up or Not for me, or hide the game. Home gets **Continue playing**, **Backlog** and **Favourites** rows.
- **Recently played.** A Home row from Steam's last played times for games added to Steam, and RomM's.
- **Game page:** "About N h to beat" from HowLongToBeat, and **More in this series** and **Similar games** rows with games you have.
- **PS4 and PS5 zips unpack themselves.** The zip is downloaded, unpacked into the game's folder, then deleted. The space check counts room for both.
- **Better Library filters.** A **Filters** button: genre, decade, couch multiplayer, rated 80% and up, play status, and show hidden games. Sort by **Rating**, and **Surprise me** opens a random game.
- **Select many games.** **Select** in the Library, pick games with A, then download them, add them to a collection or add them to Steam in one go.
- **Download queue controls.** Move waiting games up or down, **Pause all** and **Resume all**, and a **Speed limit** in Settings → Downloads (5, 10, 25 or 50 MB/s).

### Changed
- Games you hide in RomM stay out of Home, the Library and Search. Library → Filters → Show hidden games brings them back.
- Pairing with a code or QR now asks RomM for permission to change collections. Paired before 0.7.0? Pair again to use collections and play status.

## Cartridge 0.6.1

### New
- **Downloads are checked against RomM.** When a game finishes downloading, Cartridge compares every file with the size and checksum RomM keeps for it. A damaged file is deleted and the download shows "Damaged download", so **Retry** gets a fresh copy.
  - Zip, 7z, rar and CHD files get the size check only, because RomM checksums what is inside them, not the file itself.
  - Consoles RomM doesn't checksum (like PS4 and Switch) get the size check only.
  - If a retry brings exactly the same file again, the file on your server is fine and RomM's checksum is out of date. Cartridge keeps the game and tells you a rescan in RomM would fix it.
- **Storage manager (Settings → Storage), like Steam's.**
  - Each drive with a bar showing what Cartridge's games use, what everything else uses, and what is free.
  - Every downloaded game on that drive with its real size on disk, sorted by size, name or when you added it.
  - Pick any number of games with A and delete them in one go. They stay on your RomM server.
- **Warning before a download that won't fit.** If a game doesn't fit on its drive (counting what is still downloading there), Cartridge says so first and offers **Free up space**, **Download anyway** or **Cancel**.
- **Look & Feel presets.** Save your current look under a name (up to 5) and switch between them in one press: colour, background, fonts, cards, motion and sounds. Interface size and controller settings stay as they are. Each preset can be updated, renamed or deleted.
- **Pair with a QR code.** In Setup → Pairing code, **Pair with a QR code instead** shows a QR code. Scan it with your phone, approve Cartridge in RomM, and Cartridge signs in by itself. Needs a RomM version with device pairing; older versions keep the typed pairing code.

### Fixed
- **Y on the Search page now opens the on-screen keyboard** when the built-in keyboard is on (Game Mode).
- **Adding Cartridge itself to Steam could replace another shortcut** when Steam's list had a gap in its numbering. It now always takes a free spot.
- **Undo in Settings → Steam could restore the wrong file** in a rare case where the Steam step ran twice. Each change now runs exactly once, and a backup is never replaced.
- **Adding games to Steam showed no progress** while artwork was being fetched, which could look stuck with many games. The top bar now shows "Steam artwork 3/12", then "Waiting for Steam…".

## Cartridge 0.6.0 · The Steam Update

### New: your games in Steam
Settings → Steam now adds the games you downloaded to Steam as non-Steam shortcuts, so you can start them straight from Game Mode.

- **Launches the way your setup already does.** Cartridge reads the shortcuts you already have (from Steam ROM Manager, EmuDeck or made by hand) and copies each console's **Target**, **Start in** and **Launch options**, only swapping in the new game. Mixed setups work, for example EmuDeck for PS2 and Dolphin next to AppImages for RPCS3, shadPS4 and Eden.
  - Frame generation wrappers (like `mako-run` and lsfg-vk) are left out. Prefixes like `vblank_mode=0` are kept.
  - Quoting is kept exactly as your shortcuts write it.
  - PS3 games start by game ID (`%RPCS3_GAMEID%:BLUS…`) when RPCS3 already knows the game, and from the file when it doesn't.
  - PS4 games through the shadPS4 launcher start by title ID (`-g CUSA…`) or from `eboot.bin`.
  - Wii U game folders start from their `.rpx`.
  - Paths are written the way your shortcuts write them, even when a drive shows up under two paths (`/run/media/…` and `/media/…`).
- **Consoles with no shortcut yet** use the emulator Cartridge finds: the EmuDeck launcher, then an AppImage (including `~/Documents/Apps`), then a Flatpak, then RetroArch with a matching core.
- **See it before it happens.** A preview lists every Target, Start in and Launch options before Steam is touched. You can turn it off.
- **Collections.** Pick one or more of your Steam collections, none, or make a new one. Cartridge remembers the choice per console, tells you if Steam Cloud drops them, and can put them back.
- **Artwork.** Cover, background, logo and wide banner from RomM and SteamGridDB, each checked for the right shape.
- **Safe to use.** Steam closes for a moment while its files change, then opens again (Game Mode brings it back by itself). Your other shortcuts are not touched, the shortcuts file is backed up first, and **Undo last change** puts it back.
- **Games already in Steam are skipped**, whoever added them. Games that share a name get the console added, like "God of War (PS3)", or always if you prefer.
- **Per game:** More → **Add to Steam** or **Remove from Steam** on any downloaded game. PS4 games you marked as installed ask for their folder once.
- **Edit any console** in Settings → Steam → Emulators: Target, Start in and Launch options, with a Test button.
- **Optional:** add games to Steam after they download, and remove them when you delete them. Both are off by default.
- **Remove everything Cartridge added** in one go, and **Restart Steam** from Cartridge.
- **Start through Cartridge (optional, per console).** A shortcut can go through a small script instead of starting the emulator directly. If the game is gone, Cartridge opens on that game's page so you can download it again.
- Clear messages when Steam isn't installed or no account has signed in yet. Flatpak Steam works too. With several accounts, the one that signed in last is used.

### New: trophies
- **Trophies & Gamerscore tab, redesigned** in the style of the RetroAchievements tab.
- **Game logos and console wordmarks** on trophy cards and trophy pages instead of plain names, sized evenly.
- **Latest achievements on Home include trophies**, mixed with RetroAchievements, newest first. Choose All, RetroAchievements, Trophies or Off in Settings → Achievements.
- **Trophy pictures sync between devices.** Small copies are stored with your trophies in RomM, so a device that never played the game still shows them. You can turn this off.
- **Change a game's icon** from its trophy page (More → Change icon), picked from SteamGridDB.
- **Icons are always full rounded squares.** Round icons with see-through corners are skipped.
- **Better SteamGridDB matches.** Exact names come first, so Skate 3 no longer picks up "skate: recompiled".

### New: your controller's buttons
- **Button hints match the controller you're holding**: Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo (with A/B and X/Y in their real places) or Steam. Cartridge reads the real controller even when Steam presents it as an Xbox pad. Pick one yourself in Settings → Look & Feel → Button icons.

### Fixed
- **shadPS4 showed "Not found" without a trophy key.** It is now found as soon as its folder exists and says "no trophy key" until you add one in shadPS4. The shadPS4 Qt launcher's folder is no longer used, since it only holds emulator versions.
- **Portable shadPS4 in `~/Documents/Apps`** is now found for trophies.
- **Start and Select icons were too big** in the button bar, and **LT had a white box** that RT didn't.
- **Cartridge sometimes wouldn't open again until Steam restarted.** Only one Cartridge runs at a time now: opening it again brings the running one forward, and one that stopped responding is closed so the new one can start.

## Cartridge 0.5.6

### New
- **Sharp square game icons on the trophy pages.** Games in Achievements → Others, the latest unlocks and each game's trophy page now use a square, rounded icon from SteamGridDB, the same key you use for logos. Without a key, or for games SteamGridDB doesn't have, the emulator's own picture is fitted inside the square over a soft blurred copy of itself, instead of being cropped and stretched.
- **Fine-tune colours (Settings → Look & Feel → Colour).** On top of the theme, pick your own colour for:
  - **Highlights:** focus, the selected tab and switches
  - **Buttons:** main action buttons
  - **Progress bars:** downloads, achievements and trophies
  - **Background:** the waves and gradients

  Each one can go back to the theme's colour on its own, or all at once with **Use theme colours**.

### Fixed
- **shadPS4 trophies were not found** for many setups, which showed "Found · 0 games". Cartridge now:
  - reads shadPS4's settings, including a custom home folder (for example on an SD card)
  - checks the shadPS4 Qt launcher's folder, portable `user` folders next to AppImages (including Gear Lever's `~/AppImages`), Flatpak and EmuDeck storage
  - understands every trophy layout shadPS4 has used, old and new
- **The same trophy folder was listed several times** when a drive is reachable under more than one path (for example `/run/media/…` and `/media/…`). Each real folder now shows once.
- **Emulator folders that no longer hold trophies** stop showing as Found.
- **The Home header now resizes the logo to fit every time you move to a new game.** 0.5.5 only did this when the window changed size.

### Changed
- **Smoother, especially in Game Mode without the GPU:**
  - progress bars only shimmer while something is actually downloading or syncing, instead of every bar animating all the time
  - moving the selection does half the layout work it did before
  - with light effects, the animated background pauses while you navigate and picks up again a moment after you stop
  - lighter shadows and no full-screen blending with light effects

## Cartridge 0.5.5 · Fixes

### Fixed
- **Home could not scroll down right after launch.** Moving down to the next row (like Picks for you) left it half hidden behind the bottom bar until you touched the screen or used a mouse. Cartridge now starts in controller mode properly, so rows scroll into place from the first press.
- **Holding the D-pad now keeps up.** When you held a direction, the selection moved faster than the page scrolled, so it ran off screen. While a direction is held, the page now follows the selection instantly. Single presses still scroll smoothly.
- **The top of the Home header was clipped** on some games (the console name went under the top bar), when a tall logo and a long info line did not fit. The logo now shrinks to fit, and the info line stays on one line.
- **The end of a row no longer jumps to the search box.** Pressing right on the last item of a row now stays on it.

### Changed
- **LB / RB no longer switch the top tabs.** LT / RT switch tabs. The bumpers only switch sections inside a page, like RetroAchievements / Others on the Achievements tab.

## Cartridge 0.5.0 · The Customisation Update

### New
- **Colour themes that change everything.** A theme now colours the whole interface, not just the background: highlights, focus rings, buttons, tabs, chips, progress bars, panels and the background all follow it. Nothing is stuck on purple any more.
  - 14 themes: Purple, Blue, Red, Green, Orange, Pink, Teal, Midnight, and new Gold, Crimson, Lime, Sky, Lavender and Graphite.
  - **Custom colour:** pick any colour and Cartridge builds a full theme from it. Choose from 39 swatches with the controller, or use the full colour picker with a mouse or touch.
  - **Panels:** Glass (see-through, the default), Solid, or OLED black (true black background and panels).
  - **Text:** Standard, High contrast or Soft.
- **New backgrounds.** Original designs, each loosely inspired by a console menu, drawn in your theme's colours:
  - **XMB Waves** (inspired by the PSP, the original background)
  - **Ribbons** (inspired by the PS3)
  - **Bokeh** (inspired by the PS5)
  - **Blades** (inspired by the Xbox)
  - **Dots** (inspired by Nintendo)
  - **Glow** (inspired by Steam)
  - **Still:** a still gradient with no motion
  - **Game artwork**, as before
  - **Wallpaper:** any PNG, JPG or WebP image from your device, picked with the controller-friendly file browser, with Bright, Dimmed or Dark dimming.
- **Fonts.** Six bundled open-source fonts: Outfit (the default), Inter, Nunito, Rubik, Space Grotesk and Lexend.
- **Cards and grids:**
  - Box art size: Small, Medium, Large and new Huge.
  - Card corners: Rounded, Square, Soft or Extra round.
  - Spacing: Compact, Normal or Spacious.
  - Game names under box art can be turned off for a clean wall of covers.
- **Motion:**
  - **Animations:** Normal, Fast, or Reduced. Reduced turns off movement, and the background shows a still frame.
  - **Effects:** Auto, Full or Light. Light draws backgrounds at a lower resolution and frame rate and skips blur. Auto picks Light when the GPU is off (software rendering, as in Game Mode on handhelds), so it stays smooth.
- **Sounds:** three styles (Soft, Retro and Bubble) and three volumes (Low, Medium and High). You hear a preview when you pick one.
- **Reset Look & Feel** puts every look option back to the defaults.

### Changed
- **Settings → Look & Feel** is grouped into Colour, Background, Text & Size, Games & Cards, Motion & Sound, and Controls & Display, with small previews of each background and each font.
- The first-run screen, dialogs, the Quick Menu, the keyboard and the download ring follow the theme too.

## Cartridge 0.4.0 · The All Achievements Update

### New
- **Trophies from your emulators.** The Achievements tab now has two sections: **RetroAchievements** and **Others**. Switch with LB / RB or tap them. Others reads the trophies and achievements that these emulators keep on your device:
  - **RPCS3** (PS3 trophies)
  - **shadPS4** (PS4 trophies)
  - **Xenia** (Xbox 360 achievements and gamerscore)
  - **Vita3K** (PS Vita trophies)
- **Others section:**
  - A summary of your platinum, gold, silver and bronze trophies and your Xbox 360 gamerscore.
  - **Latest unlocks** across every emulator, with the trophy icon, grade and date.
  - **Games**, each with a progress bar and grade counts.
  - Open a game to see every trophy, unlocked and locked, with its grade and unlock date. Hidden trophies stay hidden until you unlock them. Filter All / Unlocked / Locked with Y. **Open in library** jumps to the game.
- **Trophies on game pages** for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and PS Vita games: a progress bar, grade counts, a row of trophy icons and **See all**. Games are matched by title ID (CUSA for PS4, the Xbox title ID in the file name) or by title. If the match is wrong or missing, open **More → Link to trophies** on the game page and pick the right set, or unlink it.
- **Finds emulators wherever they are installed:** Flatpak, AppImage, EmuDeck, RetroDECK, native packages, or any mix of them. Three layers, in order:
  1. Each emulator's own settings (RPCS3's `vfs.yml`, Vita3K's `config.yml`, shadPS4's and Xenia's usual folders, including Xenia inside Proton or Wine prefixes).
  2. A short background scan of your home, emulation and SD card folders on the first run.
  3. **Choose folder**: point Cartridge at the folder yourself. It checks the folder really holds trophy data before accepting it, and it also finds the right subfolder if you pick one level too high.
- **Settings → Achievements → Other sources:**
  - Each emulator shows **Found** (with its path and how it was found: from settings, known place, found by scan or chosen by you), **Not found** or **Off**.
  - An on/off switch per emulator.
  - **Choose folder** and **Scan again**. The folder picker shows hidden folders here, so Flatpak data under `.var` can be picked.
- **Trophies sync across devices through RomM.**
  - Trophies unlocked on your Deck, Ally or PC show up together on every device, with the name of the device that unlocked each one.
  - They are stored as a private note on the game in RomM. No new account: it uses your RomM login.
  - Unlocks are only ever added, never removed. If two devices unlocked the same trophy, the earlier date wins.
  - Games you only played on another device show up too.
  - Rename this device in Settings. Turn sync off there too.
  - If your RomM version has no notes, or your login cannot write them, Cartridge says so and keeps working on this device.
- **Trophy pop-ups.** When a trophy unlocks while Cartridge is open, a pop-up shows the trophy, its grade and the game. It can be turned off in Settings.
- **Game page header banner.** A wide banner across the top of every game page with the game's logo on it. It uses the background you picked in More, otherwise the first screenshot, otherwise a blurred cover.
- **The on-screen keyboard is back.** Settings → Look & Feel → On-screen keyboard:
  - **Auto** (the default): the built-in keyboard in Game Mode, your real keyboard on the desktop.
  - **Built-in**: always.
  - **Steam**: leaves typing to the Steam keyboard (Steam + X).
  - It opens from any text field and from the search box, and it has a Paste key.
- **Paste buttons** on text fields, for pasting API keys and addresses.

### Changed
- **PS5 console logo.** The PS5 tile now shows a filled PS5 wordmark.
- **Settings sidebar in Title Case:** Connection, Library & Sync, Storage, Console Folders, Downloads, Look & Feel, Achievements, Steam, Updates, About.
- **Settings → Achievements** is split into RetroAchievements and Other sources. The RetroAchievements header and switcher use the RetroAchievements logo.

### Notes
- Cartridge only reads the emulators' files, and it never changes them. It does not touch saves.
- Switch, Wii U, 3DS, original Xbox and PS5 emulators have no trophy or achievement system, so there is nothing to show for them.

## Cartridge 0.3.0 · The RetroAchievements Update

### New
- **Achievements tab** (between Consoles and Downloads):
  - Your RetroAchievements profile: avatar, points, softcore and true points, and what you are playing right now.
  - **Latest unlocks** from the last 30 days, with badge, points, a hardcore tag and when you got them.
  - **Recently played** games with a progress bar, achievements and points earned, and a crown on mastered games. Games that are in your RomM library are marked "In your library".
  - Open any game to see **every achievement**, unlocked and locked, with points, type (progression, win condition, missable), the unlock date, a hardcore tag and how rare it is. Filter All / Unlocked / Locked with Y. **Open in library** jumps to the game in Cartridge.
  - X refreshes. The last results are kept, so the tab still shows something offline.
- **Achievements on every game page that supports them.** Shows a progress bar, a row of badges (unlocked first, then locked) and **See all**. Games are matched by RomM's RetroAchievements ID or, if RomM has none, by an exact title match on RetroAchievements' list for that console. Consoles RetroAchievements does not support (PS3, PS4, PS5, Vita, Switch, 3DS, Xbox, Xbox 360) never show the section.
- **Latest achievements row on Home.**
- **Settings → Achievements:** sign in with your RetroAchievements username and web API key (retroachievements.org → Settings → Authentication; your password is never needed), open the tab, sign out, and turn achievements on game pages or the Home row on or off.

### Changed
- **Top bar at Steam Deck width:** with six tabs, inactive tabs show only their icon below about 1560px wide. The tab you are on keeps its label.

## Cartridge 0.2.5 · console overhaul

### Changed
- **Console tiles redesigned** (Consoles tab and the Consoles shelf on Home):
  - **Official console logos** replace the plain names: Dreamcast, Game Boy, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and the rest. They are white wordmarks from the open-source Art Book Next theme for ES-DE, downloaded once and cached in `~/.config/Cartridge/syslogos`. A console without a logo (like PS5) keeps its name.
  - **Each console in its own colours** instead of the same purple and pink everywhere: orange for Dreamcast, green for Xbox, red and blue for Switch, deep blue for PS2 and PS4, and so on. The colour sits in a dark glass gradient with a thin colour strip along the bottom, so it still matches the rest of Cartridge.
  - The tilting console pictures stay as they were, and the logo grows slightly on focus.

## Cartridge 0.2.4

### New
- **PS4 and PS5: Mark as installed.** These games are stored on RomM as zips that you extract into a folder yourself, so Cartridge could not tell they were on your device. On a PS4 or PS5 game page, open **More** (or press Y) and choose **Mark as installed**. The game then shows as on your device everywhere: the check badge on its cover, the On device filter and Home. **Unmark** (on the game page or in More) only removes the mark and never touches any files. The option only appears for PS4 and PS5 games. Marks are saved in `~/.config/Cartridge/marked.json`.
- **PS4 and PS5 folders are detected automatically.** If a folder in the console's ROM folder has the same name as the zip (for example `Bloodborne.zip` and a `Bloodborne` folder), or contains the same PlayStation title ID (CUSA12345 or PPSA12345), the game counts as installed without marking it.
- **Fetch all logos (Settings → Look & feel, under Game logos).** Gets the logo for every game in one go instead of one at a time as you browse, with a live progress bar (games checked and logos found) and a Stop button. Logos only. It uses the same order as always: your own picks, then RomM, then SteamGridDB.
- **PS5 folder mapping.** PS5 games go to a `ps5` folder in your ROMs folder, like the other consoles. You can change it in Settings → Console folders.

### Changed
- **Safer Delete.** Cartridge now refuses to delete a whole console folder or your ROMs folder, whatever path it is given.

## Cartridge 0.2.3 · the TV update

### New
- **Interface size (Settings → Look & feel).** Auto is the default: every time Cartridge starts it measures the screen and scales the whole interface so it looks like it does on a 1080p handheld. A 4K TV gets 200%, a 1440p monitor 133%, and the Ally and Steam Deck stay at 100%. You can also pick 100% to 300% yourself. It follows window resizes and fullscreen changes.

### Changed
- **Smooth on TVs.** Big screens (1440p and up) now always use the GPU, including when Steam or Game Mode launches Cartridge. Drawing a 4K screen without the GPU is what made it slow and stuttery. Handheld-size screens keep the software rendering that is proven to launch there. If the screen size cannot be read at startup, Cartridge notices the big window and restarts once with the GPU.
- **GPU safety net under Steam.** If the GPU fails at startup, Cartridge switches to Compatible rendering by itself, now under Steam and Game Mode too.
- **Background waves** draw at the right sharpness for the interface size, and on a big screen without the GPU they use a lighter setting.

### Fixed
- **Change cover / logo / background showed images stacked on top of each other** when a game had many results. Every image now has its own full-size tile and the list scrolls. Logo tiles sit on a checkered backdrop so white and black logos are both visible.

## Cartridge 0.2.2

### New
- **More menu on every game page** (the new "More" button, or press Y):
  - **Change cover**, **Change logo** and **Change background**: browse SteamGridDB images for that game and pick one. You can switch to another SteamGridDB match or search with a different name.
  - **Reset artwork**: goes back to RomM's cover and the automatic logo.
  - **Refresh details from RomM** and **Show file location**.
  - Your picks are saved in `~/.config/Cartridge/artwork.json` and used everywhere: grids, Home, the media bar and the game page.

### Changed
- **Logos are the same visual size.** Cartridge trims empty space around each logo and gives every logo the same amount of screen area. Tall emblems (like Twisted Metal) grow and very wide wordmarks shrink, so they sit at a similar size to Midnight Club 3.
- **Black logos show up.** When SteamGridDB's logo is black, Cartridge uses the white version if there is one, otherwise it draws the black logo in white.
- **Game page layout.** The info box (publisher, developer and so on) sits directly under the cover at the same width, and the screenshot row stops before it instead of sliding underneath.
- **Touch scrolling rewritten.** Swipe rows sideways and pages up and down with momentum. Tapping a game no longer makes the page jump. It also works when Game Mode sends touches as mouse input, and you can drag with a mouse too.
- **Steam Deck width.** On game pages the top bar hides the word "Cartridge" (the icon stays) so the back button, search box and clock fit. Button hints no longer run off the edge.

### Fixed
- **Add to Steam** detects a running Steam reliably. Before, it could miss it, and Steam would put its old shortcut back when it closed.

## Cartridge 0.2.1

### Fixed
- **Launching from Steam.** Add to Steam now points Steam at a small launch script instead of the AppImage. The script removes the Steam overlay and Steam's runtime libraries from Cartridge's environment and starts it without the Chromium sandbox, which could kill it under Steam before it even opened. Every Steam launch is logged to `~/.config/Cartridge/steam-launch.log`. **After updating, open Settings → Steam → Add to Steam once** so your shortcut uses the script.
- **Game logos.** Logos now also come from SteamGridDB: add a free API key in Settings → Look & feel (steamgriddb.com → Preferences → API). RomM's own logos are still used first when your server has them.
- **Sharper background.** The XMB waves are drawn at full resolution instead of being scaled up, with no change in frame rate.
- **Starting focus.** Home opens on your games, not the search box.

## Cartridge 0.2.0

The first big update. Everything since 0.1.0 is in here.

### New
- **Search box in the top bar.** Start typing from any screen and results filter as you type. Press Y to jump to it.
- **Game logos.** Home and game pages show the game's logo instead of plain text. Turn it off in Settings → Look & feel → Game logos.
- **Media bar.** The top of Home shows artwork of the highlighted game and swaps as you move.
- **Background colors.** Eight PSP XMB-style colors in Settings → Look & feel: Purple, Blue, Red, Green, Orange, Pink, Teal and Midnight.
- **Touch mode.** Tapping the screen no longer shows a mouse cursor. The cursor only appears when a real mouse moves. Pick Auto, Touch or Mouse in Look & feel.
- **In-app updates.** Settings → Updates → Check for updates downloads the new version and swaps it in on restart. Same file, same Steam shortcut, nothing to reinstall.
- **Screenshots.** Quick Menu → Take screenshot saves to `~/Pictures/Cartridge`.
- **One-line installer.** Downloads the AppImage, makes it executable and adds it to your app menu.
- **Add to Steam.** Settings → Steam adds Cartridge as a non-Steam game with its cover, banner, logo and icon.

### Changed
- **No more on-screen keyboard.** Text boxes are real inputs: type with any connected keyboard, or press Steam + X in Game Mode for the Steam keyboard.
- **LT / RT switch tabs** (Home, Library, Consoles, Downloads, Settings). LB / RB flip between consoles or collections.
- **Box art is 2:3**, like Steam, and no longer cropped at the top. Corners are less rounded.
- **Smoother.** Scrolling and focus now hold 60fps on handhelds (up from roughly 25 to 30).

### Fixed
- **Rendering under Steam.** Cartridge uses software rendering whenever Steam or Game Mode launches it. Launching from the app menu still uses the GPU.
- **Blank grey window and no launch** on some handhelds (0.1.0 and 0.1.1).
- **Duplicate "ready to play" messages** after a download finished.

### Update
Already on 0.1.2 or later: open Cartridge from the app menu in Desktop Mode, go to Settings → Updates → Check for updates, then restart. Then press Settings → Steam → Add to Steam once.

New install, in Desktop Mode → Konsole:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdu2304/cartridge/main/install.sh | bash
```
